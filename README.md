# Churn-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The main objective of the Customer Churn Prediction project is to analyze the demographics and financial information of bank customers, including factors like age, gender, credit score, country, balance, and more, in order to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or not. Customer churn, the decision of customers to leave a bank, can significantly impact the bank's business and profitability. By accurately predicting customer churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and enhance customer satisfaction.
